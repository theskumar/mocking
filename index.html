## Testing
- Prevent bugs
- Prevent regressions
- If not crucial, it's important
]
???
- this talk going to include a lot of tests
- If not crucial atleast important. 
- unit tests, integration tests, or any brand new test.
- defend us against bugs
- save us during regressions
- and save us from going to office on weekends.

# Let's Begin, Part 1

- Let's begin with our journey
- understand few things about mock
- and how to use it

# Mock simulates <br><br>.red[the looks and behaviour] of real objects.
???
- Mocking means creating objects 
- that simulates the looks and behaviour of real objects.
- in real world, test can include a lot of complexity
- and dependencies
- In order to isolate the object we can mock all the other real objects

???
- lost a hell lot of gadgets
- 2nd, it can't cut, it's fake
- As with all the analogies, they are very easy to understand 
- but they are not 100% accurate.

# Mocks != Stub
???
- might heard words like dummies, fakes, stubs
- They are somewhat similar in a way
---
class: middle
## Stubs
refers to writing classes or functions but not yet implementing them or have a predetermined behaviour.
```
class Foo(object):
  def bar(self):
    pass

  def tank(self):
    return 'bla bla bla'
```
???
- stubs refers to writing classes or functions but not yet implementing them or have a predetermined behaviour.
- Stub is simple fake object. It just makes sure test runs smoothly.
- Mock is smarter stub. You verify Your test passes through it.

# Mock()
???
- mock has well documented 
- can fake any property or behaviour
---
class: middle
# Mock
```python
>>> from unittest.mock import Mock
>>> m = Mock()
>>> m.foo = 1
>>> m.foo
1
>>> m.bar
<Mock name='mock.bar' id='4593003768'>
```

# Mock()
# MagicMock()
---
class: middle
## MagicMock
Similar to mock but has default implementation for magic methods:
<pre>
__lt__         __str__
__gt__         __init__
__len__        __hash__
__bool__       __exit__
...
</pre>

```python
>>> from unittest.mock import MagicMock
>>> m = MagicMock()
>>> len(m)  # or m.__len__()
0
```

# Mock()
# MagicMock()
# patch()
---
class: middle
# Patching
```python
from unittest.mock import patch

with patch('pydelhi.conference.send_sms') as sms_sender_mock:
  sms_sender_mock.return_value = True
```
???
- path to module/object as string
---
class: middle
# Patching

## .red[`'pydelhi.conference.send_sms'`]
point to place with object was used rather than where it's defined

.pull-left[
```
## sms.py

def send_sms(phone, text):
   pass
```
]
.pull-right[
```
## pydelhi/conference.py

from sms import send_sms
send_sms('...', '...')
```
]
???
- key to patching is point to place with object was used rather than where it's defined

# System calls

# Streams

def test_oembed_photo_request(self, urlopen):

## IO operations

```python
@patch.object(DataLoader, '_get_file_contents')
def test_parse_json_from_file(self, mock_def):
  mock_def.return_value = ({"a": 1, "b": 2}, True)
  output = self._loader.load_from_file('dummy_json.txt')
  self.assertEqual(output, dict(a=1, b=2))
```

def test_500_retry(self, sleep_mock):

  # Create a bucket, a key and a file
  with self.assertRaises(BotoServerError):

## Unpredictable results
```
with mock.patch('random.random', return_value=0.0):
  with self.assertChanges(get_timeline_size, before=10, after=5):
    backend.add(timeline, next(self.records))
